# DrinksMachineSimulator
Game Jam Game 

This was a Game Jam game made in 3 days in Unity 3D in 2015.
There were 3 people in our team, Artists Eric Tahiri and Madeleine Chappell and myself as the programmer.
The song used is 'Hardstyle Rising' by DJ Ephixa.
We got permission to use the song in our game from the artist during the Game Jam and do not own any rights to this song.

I've put up the game scripts here, the game is playable on PC in a zip, link:
